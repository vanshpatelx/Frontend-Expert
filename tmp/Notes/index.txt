We upload builder file like HTML/CSS/JS not react code

Why React ?
1. Help in complexity, normal Js code is too tough write with big applications, we also have options like JQeury and BackBoneJS which help in complexity of DOMs, but till complex.

React Jargons
1. State
2. Components
3. Re-Rendering

State : data whoich change with time or event Ex. Counter, Views, Post, Feed, Notifications
Component : How a DOM element should render given a state, It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML Snippets
Re-Render : State change trigger re-render, acutal DOM manipulate when state changes
